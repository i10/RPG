# RPG

RPG is a tool for generating human-readable passwords that strives at being as simple as possible

* Passwords are generated from syllables, numbers, and symbols
* Syllables can be capitalized to enhance security at a very low cost for the user.
* Symbols are picked from the iPhone's first (Symbols 1) and second (Symbols 2) keyboard layout to allow quick entry on your mobile phone.
* Certain characters can be excluded from the password generation process to avoid typographical similarities (l vs. I)
* For each password a secure hash (SHA-1) is generated consisting of 40 HEX characters, which can be used for extra strong passwords.
* A minimized version of the RPG window stays on top of other applications to aid password entry where copy&paste is not available
* Passwords and Hashes can be generated via the Services Menu from other applications (enable in System Preferences, Keyboard)
